Hello there fellow gamer!

In order to play this awesome game there are a few things we need to discuss.

1. You must keep all the files in the same folder, if you don't than the whole 
world will explode! (or the program may just not run, idk)

2. to control the square, move your mouse around the screen

3. to control the circle, use the arrow keys on your keyboard

4. to win, you must perfectly match both the mouse and keyboard
